# Hearing Your Future {#hearing-your-future}

*Hearing Your Future* is a podcast which accompanies the Coding Your Future guidebook. We talk to [graduands](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/graduand) and graduates of computer science, see figure \@ref(fig:collage-fig), to hear more about their journey from student to professional. As part of their exit interview we ask them what happens after graduation? What comes next?
