(ref:captioncycloturing) Paying homage to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) at a mural on the [Princess Parkway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5103_road) by [tankpetrol.com](http://tankpetrol.com/). According to [Jonathan Swinton](https://www.manturing.net/jonathan), Turing is the ‚Äúpatron saint of Manchester‚Äù [@manturing]. As a [Manchester icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Manchester), he is commemorated locally by the [Alan Turing building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Building), the [Alan Turing Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Memorial), [some blue plaques](https://duncan.hull.name/2021/07/07/turings-house/) and the [Alan Turing Way](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alan+Turing+Way,+Manchester/) [@turingway]

## Kilburn office {#office}

My office is LF25 in the Kilburn building shown in figure \@ref(fig:kilburn-fig). From the Byte cafe on the lower first floor, go through the double doors on the South side of the building and down the ramp. LF25 is at the bottom of the ramp on the right, see [bit.ly/Kilburn-lower-first-floor](https://bit.ly/Kilburn-lower-first-floor).

## Student support {#sso}

I might not be the best person to talk to, depending on what you want. If you're a student, you might be better off contacting student support in person by the neon signs in the [engineering building](https://www.mecd.manchester.ac.uk/), see figure \@ref(fig:sso-fig).


```{r sso-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:captionstudentsupport)", out.width = "100%"}

```
(ref:captionstudentsupport) The Student Support office on the first floor of the [engineering building](https://www.mecd.manchester.ac.uk/) are here to help you, they should be your first port of call. If you have something more specific about a personal, academic or employment issue I can help.

## Kilburn building directions {#kilburn}

The [Kilburn building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilburn_Building) shown in figure \@ref(fig:kilburn-fig) is about 20 minutes walk from either [Manchester Piccadilly](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/man.aspx) (MAN) or ten minutes from [Manchester Oxford Road](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/mco/details.aspx) (MCO).
