(ref:captioncycloturing) Paying homage to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) at a mural on the [Princess Parkway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5103_road) by [tankpetrol.com](http://tankpetrol.com/). According to [Jonathan Swinton](https://www.manturing.net/jonathan), Turing is the ‚Äúpatron saint of Manchester‚Äù [@manturing]. As a [Manchester icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Manchester), he is commemorated locally by the [Alan Turing building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Building), the [Alan Turing Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Memorial), [some blue plaques](https://duncan.hull.name/2021/07/07/turings-house/) and the [Alan Turing Way](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alan+Turing+Way,+Manchester/) [@turingway]

## Kilburn building directions

From the train stations, it takes about 20 minutes to walk from [Manchester Piccadilly](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/man.aspx) (MAN) and ten minutes from [Manchester Oxford Road](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/mco/details.aspx) (MCO). Our official postcode (M13 9PL) takes you to [University Place](http://www.conference.manchester.ac.uk/venues/search/details/?property=10) (which looks like a giant tin of baked beans) next door, so you're better of using the [what3words locations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49319760) [@what3words] below which are more accurate:

* Google map of the Kilburn building [bit.ly/directions-to-kilburn-building](http://bit.ly/directions-to-kilburn-building)
* There are two ground floor entrances to the Kilburn building, North and South
  + North entrance: [what3words.com/port.museum.rips](https://what3words.com/port.museum.rips)
  + South entrance: [what3words.com/common.wiping.email](https://what3words.com/common.wiping.email)
* There is no formal reception so the best place to meet is [bit.ly/ByteCafe](http://bit.ly/ByteCafe) on the first floor
* See also [cs.manchester.ac.uk/about/maps-and-travel](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about/maps-and-travel/)
