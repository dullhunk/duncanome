# Coding Your Future

Your future is bright, your future needs coding. So let's starting coding your future.

*Coding Your Future* is a guidebook written to help students design, build, test and code their futures in computing, see figure \@ref(fig:cdyf-fig). Written by yours truly, [@cdyf] the full text of the book is freely available online at [www.cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me). If you'd prefer to read it in ebook format, you can also download it in a single file, see section \@ref(downloading).

## Reading your future {#reading}

Coding your future is a guidebook and course is aimed at ALL students in higher education. While the guide supports undergraduate teaching at the University of Manchester, it doesn’t actually matter:

* *where* in the world you are studying
* what *stage* of your degree you are at, from first year through to final year
* what *level* you are studying at, foundation, undergraduate or postgraduate
* what *institution* you are studying at, this book is University and institution agnostic
* what *subject* you are studying, as long as you are **computationally curious**

*Coding your Future* has something for any student of computing, both those inside and outside of Computer Science departments. 👨🏿‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩‍💻👩🏿‍💻
