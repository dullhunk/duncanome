# Researching the Future {#research}

My research interests are in [Computer Science Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science_education) and [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy). [@CERhandbook; @JohnBiggs2011; @Fry2014] I'm interested in methods that can improve learning and student experience using techniques like [coding your future](https://www.cdyf.me), [journal clubbing](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), [industrial mentoring](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/), [live music](#tuningcomplete), [working with schools](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/coding-their-future.html), [editing Wikipedia](#wikipedia) and more. Previously I've worked in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), [knowledge representation and reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) and [symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence), see publications in section \@ref(publications).

(ref:captionprotest) Too many educational practices are not backed up by good evidence that they actually work. More evidence is needed to support many of the claims made about effective pedagogy. _Wikipedian Protester_ cartoon by [Randall Munroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe) at [xkcd.com/285](https://xkcd.com/285/)  published under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)

## SIGCSE
Computer Science has only been taught to undergraduates in the UK for 50 short years [@babygrowsup; @sigcse50], so there's lots of open questions about how to teach the practical, theoretical and professional aspects of the subject. To that end:

* I'm an [active member](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81350580198) of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM) and it's Special Interest Group (SIG) in Computer Science Education ([sigcse.org](https://sigcse.org)). In 2020 I founded the [ACM SIGCSE journal club](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and chair the monthly Manchester meetup. Anyone is welcome to join, see [sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/join-us](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/join-us)
* I serve on the program committee of the [United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UIKICER)](https://www.ukicer.com/) conference, on the board of [UK ACM SIGCSE](https://uki-sigcse.acm.org/about) and have served on the program committee for [Computing Education & Practice (CEP)](http://community.dur.ac.uk/cep.conference) conference at Durham University

## Industrial Mentoring
Since we started the [industrial mentoring scheme for software engineers](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/) in 2015, more than 1000 students have been through the mentoring scheme with 250 students taking the course every year. We are very grateful for continued support from our industrial partners in making this happen.

Mentors meet with a group of six second year students for two one hour meetings and do some gentle code review of their gitlab repository, as they start to fix bugs and add features to a large open source software project. You don‚Äôt *need* to be an expert in the tools students are using (Java, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, JUnit and Ant) it is more about the general process (and politics) of building and testing high quality software in large and distributed teams, than the specifics of the [stendhalgame.org](https://stendhalgame.org/) codebase we happen to be using. Mentors are typically software engineers, both junior and senior.

<!--## Vertical tutoring {#vt}
We are currently piloting a vertical tutoring (VT) scheme, see [vertical tutoring](vertical-tutoring.html) for details. [@vtbernard; @druryvert]-->

## Coderdojo & Code Club  {#codeclub}
I'm a volunteer at [coderdojo.com](https://coderdojo.com/) [@coderdojo]. Coder [dojos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo) are local community engineering clubs for young people; with several other volunteers I help out at [CoderDojo North West](https://twitter.com/coderdojonw). We meet once a month to help young people broaden their digital and computational horizons.

Previously I lead an after school [CodeClub](https://codeclub.org) as part of a global network of free coding clubs for 9--13 year olds. [@codeclub] As with coderdojo, the aim is to have fun using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [@Resnick2009] python and other interesting technology we can get our hands on including [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [@raspberrypi] [Micro:bits](https://microbit.org/), [@Sentance2017] [LEGO¬Æ MINDSTORMS¬Æ](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/mindstorms), [@Papert1980; @Klassner2003] [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com), [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) [@Aaron2016] and [CodeBug](http://www.codebug.org.uk/) etc.

## Wikipedia {#wikipedia}
Wikipedia and [wikidata.org](https://www.wikidata.org) [@Vrandecic2014; @Turki2019] are powerful tools for improving both digital skills and communication skills, regardless of your age or level of computer literacy, [@Proffitt2018; @goodfaith; @Littlejohn2019] particularly in the following areas:

* [Literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy) generally, the ability to read and write in any natural language. The literacy skills of some engineers and scientists leaves plenty of room for improvement, but literacy has many overlapping dimensions including:
  + [Data literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_literacy) the ability to read and write (data)
  + [Digital literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy) the ability to read and write (digitally)
  + [Computer literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_literacy) the ability to read and write (using a computer)
  + [Information literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy) the ability to read and write (information)
  + [Scientific literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literacy) the ability to read and write (science). How many people do you know who _unashamedly_ proclaim their scientific or mathematical illiteracy? [@nevergoodatmaths; @gowersproblem; @mathillit]

As an experienced and long serving editor of Wikipedia since 2004, I organise and participate in [Wikipedia training events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon) which recruit new Wikipedia editors. Some recent examples include:

## Tuning Complete {#tuningcomplete}
Tuning complete started as a [boy band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band) in [Manchester, Lancashire üåπ](https://duncan.hull.name/2019/07/05/mancashire/), named after the famous Computer Scientist [Alan Tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). We use his eponymous [Tuning machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) to make music which is quality assured using the [Tuning test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).

```{r beatles-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.cap='(ref:captionjohnpaulringogeorge)'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tuning-complete.jpg")
```

(ref:captionjohnpaulringogeorge) The founder members of Tuning Complete were Jez Lloyd, Steve Furber, Justin Timberfake and yours truly. With apologies to [Richard Avedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Avedon) and his psychedelic portraits of John, Paul, Ringo and George. Artwork by Jez Lloyd.


Our founding members, shown in figure \@ref(fig:beatles-fig) include:

* [Jez Lloyd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jez-lloyd-84077069): Bachelor of Music, DJ and backing vocals
* [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber): bass guitar.
    + ‚ÄúAll we've got is Steve's guitar, [three chords and the truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Chords_and_the_Truth).‚Äù [@harlan; @allalongthewatchtower]
* [Justin Timberfake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake): lead vocals, lead dancer [@cantstopthefeeling]
* Duncan Hull: MC,
    + synth ([MicroKORG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroKORG))
    + drum machine ([Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/))
    + embarrassing dad dancing [@daddancing]

Theoretically, we are a [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) band. [@Turing1937; @turingcomplete] Artistically, this means that what we lack in youth, good looks, fame, fortune, fashion sense, fanbase and back catalogue we compensate for with:

ü§ì Musical geekery [@musicnmaths; @behindthemusic]  
ü§ì Mathematical geekery [@plusmaths]   
ü§ì Computer geekery [@Aaron2016]

We played our debut gigs to packed theatres of over 200 second year & first year undergraduate computer science students in the autumn of 2019 and are currently planning future live events while writing a (hopefully) lucrative hit single, working title: [#LivingTheDream](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LivingTheDream). If you would like to book our services for your next event, hackathon, wedding, bar mitzvah etc, please contact our agent Mrs. Kilburn shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mrskilburn-fig).

```{r mrskilburn-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.cap='Mrs. Kilburn is our manager, booking agent and promoter. She is the power behind our boy band throne, so all bookings must be approved and scheduled by her office. Please do not approach band members directly with gig requests or offers of marriage, we are all answered for!'}

### From boy band to Musical Collective {#collective}
After several years of rehearsing, touring and time in the studio, we decided to invite women to join our boy band, because we soon realised they could do all the things we weren't so good at such as:

* Singing
* Dancing
* Performing
* Looking good
* Reading and writing music
* Playing musical instruments

So, as of 2024, Tuning Complete are a [musical collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_collective) with a fluid membership model, we're always looking for new members to contribute. Newer members have included:

* [Billie Fakish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Eilish): guest vocalist [@badguy]
* [Olivia Fakerigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo): guest vocalist [@good4u]
* [Faky Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry): guest vocalist [@roar]
* [Faker Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift): guest vocalist [@calmdown]

If you can sing, dance or play a musical instrument and would like to join us, please get in touch.

4. A review of tools for managing large bibliographies, published in [_PLOS Computational Biology_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_Computational_Biology) [@defrosting]  

The first paper for which I was formally acknowledged was on simulated environmental change in the subarctic published in [_New Phytologist_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Phytologist) [@subarctic]. I was a humble field assistant, not a co-author, one of the *absolut* best summer jobs I've ever had!
