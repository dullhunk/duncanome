<p>Coding their future is a collaboration &amp; partnership between secondary schools and the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the University of Manchester. Our aims are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve and support computing education before, during and after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/subjects/z34k7ty">GCSE Computer Science</a>, particularly at key stages 3, 4 and 5. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-shutdownrestart">Furber 2012</a>, <a href="references#ref-afterthereboot">2017</a>; <a href="references#ref-cse">Sentance et al. 2023</a>; <a href="references#ref-cambridgegcse">Swan et al. 2013</a>)</span>

<li>
<a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/social-responsibility/widening-participation/">widen participation in higher education</a>, especially in under-represented groups. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-assir">Palmer 2023</a>; <a href="references#ref-classceiling">Friedman and Laurison 2020</a>; <a href="references#ref-nicebutdim">Green and Kynaston 2019</a>; <a href="references#ref-breakintoelite">Rajan 2019</a>)</span>
</li>
<li>enable our undergraduate students to develop their leadership and communication skills by working with young people in the classroom</li>
</ul>
<p>The University provides schools with a final year student who can teach Computer Science in your school or college as a teaching assistant (TA). In return, the school provides our undergraduate students with a safe and supportive environment in which to teach which extends and augments your current curriculum. This can either be an after school, extension / lunchtime club or during scheduled lesson time, typically between year 7 and 13. This is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_Ambassadors_Scheme">Undergraduate Ambassador Scheme</a> (UAS), <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-uas">Singh 2005</a>; <a href="references#ref-Cooper2005">Cooper and D’Inverno 2005</a>)</span> and school placements <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-Moller2019">Moller and Powell 2019</a>)</span> except students work is assessed using our final year project framework. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-COMP30030">Morris 2019a</a>, <a href="references#ref-COMP30040">2019b</a>)</span></p>

</h2>
<p>Coding, programming, software engineering and computer science - whatever you want to call it, builds key foundational skills and knowledge that <strong>all</strong> students need to learn regardless of their aspirations. Children don’t learn to code just to become coders, they learn to code so they can build problem solving skills and develop an understanding how the digital world they inhabit functions. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-peytoncode">Jones 2023</a>)</span> Sam Aaron, creator of the <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">sonic-pi.net</a> makes this case in figure <a href="coding-their-future#fig:sonic-pi-fig">4.2</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Since these projects were started in 2012, our undergraduate students have worked in twenty different schools in Greater Manchester. Participating organisations are mostly non-selective state schools, to align with the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/vision/">University of Manchester’s values of social responsibility and civic engagement</a>. Current and previous participating schools are shown in table <a href="coding-their-future#tab:schooltable">4.1</a>, ranked by the percentage of their students entitled to free school meals (FSM).</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table style="width:99%;" class="table table-sm">
<caption>
<span id="tab:schooltable">Table 4.1: </span> Schools our undergraduate students have worked with in teaching computing in since 2013, ordered by the percentage of students entitled to free school meals (FSM). As of 2023, the UK average for students entitled to FSM according to gov.uk is <strong>23.8%</strong>. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-averagefsm">Servant 2023</a>)</span> This number has been increasing over the last decade as the UK falls behind on tackling child poverty <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-childpoverty">Foster and Borrett 2024</a>; <a href="references#ref-bbcfsm">Editor 2022</a>)</span> Note that all private schools have an FSM percentage of zero because their students do not qualify for benefits, which makes it difficult to compare intakes of state and private schools. It seems likely that children in private schools probably don’t need free school meals anyway.</caption>

<p>The University of Manchester will provide your school or college with at least one student ambassador with some relevant training who has completed two years of study in Computer Science and has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good knowledge of, and enthusiasm for Computer Science</li>
<li>Completed <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service">Disclosure and Barring Service</a> (DBS) clearance</li>
<li>An interest in teaching and working with young people</li>

<p>In return, we expect that the school provides the undergraduate student with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities to engage with a classroom or after school club of children as a Teaching Assistant (TA). This is typically for around one or two hours during term time. Initially, this could be through classroom observation and teacher assistance, culminating in the student delivering at least one lesson (and potentially a series of lessons) with your support and guidance</li>
<li>Advice, suggestions, feedback, assessment and encouragement from you to suggest the kinds of resources that would be useful, appropriate or engaging for the Computer Science curriculum you are teaching</li>
<li>Classroom and behaviour management: the students are not trained teachers and will be relying on your expertise in classroom and behaviour management.</li>

<p>Undergraduates typically develop a range of resources. The project will involve development of a computer-based system together with supporting activities, lessons and resources. The resource could be a variety of things including, a game, robotics, animations, hardware (Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc) or software, intended to enthuse school students at one of the Key stages 3 or 4 about fundamental concepts in computing preferably linked to one of the new Computer Science curricula.</p>

<p>The projects run for 6 months from September to March, divided into three phases.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>September to October</strong> Observation in the classroom teaching by the student around once per week. Development of ideas for an educational tool that the student will make, with the advice of the classroom teacher</li>
<li>
<strong>November to January</strong> From November to January, our students develop and tests prototype tool (or tools) with the supporting material, this can happen sooner for students who make a quick start to the project.</li>
<li>
<strong>February to April</strong> From February to April, our students are expected to liaise closely with teachers to develop an educational tool that will be of use in the classroom using teachers’ suggestions as to what is appropriate to build. Students will spend some time in a classroom working closely with teachers and students developing and delivering a new resource for teaching. More details on final year projects can be found in COMP300, the undergraduates already know what is required from their project</li>

<p>Formal supervision and mentoring is undertaken by the university (Duncan and David), but we will ask you to fill in a one page form on your assessment of their progress during their time at your school, we very much value your input and hope that these projects can beneficial for both your school and the University. We don’t want to burden you with unnecessary bureaucracy that all teachers battle with!</p>

<p>So why would you, an undergraduate student, want to work on an education project in secondary school? The UK government would like Computer Science should be taught in all secondary schools in the UK. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-afterthereboot">Furber 2017</a>)</span> However, in many UK schools there is a shortage of teachers who are trained in Computer Science, consequently, many teachers find themselves being asked to teach a subject they may know little about. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-shutdownrestart">Furber 2012</a>)</span></p>
<p>Undergraduate students can make a significant difference here, by supporting teachers in the classroom to create and deliver new classroom resources in Computer Science. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-computinged">Hull 2020a</a>)</span> In addition, undergraduate students will have the chance to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop leadership skills in the classroom</li>
<li>gain valuable experience of working on “real world” problems in a stimulating environment</li>
<li>improve your communication skills, especially spoken communication
work as part of a team (in the school) and join a small group of like-minded undergraduate students (in the University) working on related projects</li>
<li>test your knowledge &amp; technical ability in a challenging and dynamic environment working with young people</li>
<li>last, but not least, there is a good chance you will have lots of fun and have a rewarding experience of teaching
make yourself more employable by doing all of the above</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Who is Involved?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#who-is-involved"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Initially, the number of undergraduate students involved in these projects will be less than ten. We also require that you will have a minimum of a 2:1 or 1st in your second year exams. Projects are co-supervised by Duncan with additional supervision from an experienced member of teaching staff at a participating school.</p>
<p>We have carefully selected schools in Manchester that are relatively easy for you to get to, are already teaching Computer Science and have supportive staff and teachers in place to help you. You will be expected to work directly with school children with the support of the teaching staff in your school. Schools we have worked with are all the Manchester area.</p>

</h3>
<p>You will be expected to work closely with the teacher to develop resources that</p>
<ul>
<li>engage students with one or more aspects of the new Computer Science curriculum at an appropriate key stage. This is usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_3">key stage 3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_4">key stage 4</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_5">key stage 5</a> ages 11-18.</li>
<li>complement <strong>and extend</strong> the schools current provision for computer science in the school</li>
<li>a substantial piece of software or hardware, this is a requirement for all projects in Computer Science</li>
</ul>
<p>During the project you will be spending a significant amount of time in the classroom, visiting your school every week during school term time throughout the duration of your project to develop resources. These must include a computer-based teaching tool which may use, for example, Raspberry Pi’s, visual aids, demonstrations, videos, online questionnaires, formative feedback, games, drones, robotics, music, <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-Aaron2016">Samuel Aaron, Blackwell, and Burnard 2016</a>)</span> algorithms <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-Kubica2012">Kubica 2012</a>)</span> or even just the command line <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-conquerthecommandline">Smedley 2019</a>)</span> etc.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Conquer the command line is part of the The MagPi essentials series, there are lots of others like it you may find useful on using the camera module, gaming in python, simple electronics and more at &lt;a href="https://store.rpipress.cc" class="uri"&gt;https://store.rpipress.cc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> In addition, guidance on classroom use, such as a lesson or series of lessons to support the tool. Remember that you don’t actually need a computer, see <a href="https://csunplugged.org">Computer Science Unplugged</a>: Computer Science without a Computer. <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-Bell2018">Bell and Vahrenhold 2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>All deliverables for standard final year projects will be expected of these projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>first semester presentation</li>
<li>demonstration of the resource being used in the classroom</li>
<li>final written report</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessments for these projects will be as for standard projects, <span class="citation">(<a href="references#ref-COMP30030">Morris 2019a</a>, <a href="references#ref-COMP30040">2019b</a>)</span> but part of the evaluation of the project will be a classroom demonstration, a description and evaluation of which should be included in your final report.</p>

<p>COVID 19 has accelerated changes in the way we teach and learn, from primary and secondary school right through to higher education. As a teacher, you need to get clued up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning">blended learning</a>. A good place to start is with <a href="http://www.elearning.fse.manchester.ac.uk/fseta/moving-to-blended-learning-part-1-terminology-and-concepts/">Moving to Blended Learning, Part 1: Terminology and Concepts</a>, then take a look the video below with Steve Pettifer explaining techniques for slides that work for blended learning videos:</p>

<p>So you’ve selected <em>Coding their future</em> as your third year project and now you are ready to get started. There are plenty of resources to help you prepare and improve your effectiveness in the classroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Work with young people</strong>
<ul>
<li>Any experience of working with young people will be beneficial, if you have the time and opportunity over the summer you can get some experience of working with young people for example through <a href="https://codeclub.org/">codeclub.org</a> and <a href="https://coderdojo.com/">coderdojo.com</a>. If you’re in Manchester over the summer, see <a href="https://mcrcoderdojo.org.uk/">mcrcoderdojo.org.uk</a> which meets every month at the Manchester Technology Centre on Oxford Road, they are always looking for new volunteers.</li>
<li>It doesn’t have to be coding either, you could get involved with any activities such as sporting events or others, see <a href="https://find-volunteering.manchester.ac.uk/">find-volunteering.manchester.ac.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
