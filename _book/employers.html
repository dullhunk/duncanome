<p>If you are an employer, graduates and undergraduates are an important part of the future of your organisation. Collaborating with us in the Department of Computer Science is one of the best ways to encourage students from the University of Manchester to join your organisation as employees both before and after they graduate, see figure <a href="employers.html#fig:graduating-your-fig">2.1</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re not recruiting graduates, your organisation may suffer in the longer term as talented and young employees decide to work for other employers. Recruiting graduates is a cost effective way to build the skills and knowledge your organisation needs to succeed in the future.</p>

<p>We collaborate with a wide range of employers from the smallest bedroom startup to the worlds largest multi-national corporations, and are always looking for more organisations that can offer our students a stimulating working environment to start their careers.

<p>Our annual Computer Science careers fair is held in the Kilburn building in autumn, we typically have around 30 employers exhibiting over two days. As space is limited, we are always over-subscribed and are not able to accommodate every employer that our students will be interested in. We give priority to employers that offer internships, placements and graduate roles and have contributed to our community through the activities described on this page. The central careers service also organises:</p>
<ul>
<li>the big careers fair every autumn, see the <a href="https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/events/">events</a>

<li>a smaller careers fair in May</li>

</h2>
<p>If you aren’t willing or able to exhibit at careers fairs, we also run ad-hoc drop-in sessions where employers can come in and set up a stand in the foyer to talk to computer science students informally on their way to and from lectures. These usually happen during lunch in <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/">term time</a>.

<p>If you would like to co-supervise a project student in collaboration with an academic member of staff, there are several options. The best option depends on the domain, level and duration of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Bachelors projects</strong>: these are completed in the final year of a Bachelors degree and last for six months, starting in September and finishing in March. Projects are proposed (and offered to students) in March and start in September of the same year.</li>
<li>
<strong>Masters projects</strong>: again these are six months in duration but start in March and finish in September. Projects are proposed (and offered to students) in the preceding November.</li>
<li>
<strong>PhD projects</strong>: For industrially sponsored or co-supervised projects, speak to the research office at <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/">cs.manchester.ac.uk/research</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Knowledge Transfer Partnerships</strong>: We have a range of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-transfer-partnerships-what-they-are-and-how-to-apply">KTPs</a>, speak to the research office for details</li>
<li>
<strong>Impact Acceleration Accounts</strong>: We have a range of <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/innovation/fundingforimpact/impact-acceleration-accounts/">IAAs</a>, speak to the research office for details</li>

This goes out to around ~1500 Bachelors and Masters Computer Science students in Manchester each week. If you have vacancies or events you would like our students to know about, you can advertise them at <a href="https://careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk/">careerconnect.manchester.ac.uk</a>, and let me know when they are live in the system, then I can highlight them to the weekly newsletter.

<p>There is a thriving community of engineers and <a href="https://www.accelerateme.co/">entrepreneurs</a> in Manchester and across the North of England. One of the best ways to recruit engineers and scientists is to join and <em>contribute</em> to the community. Get involved in events, <a href="https://www.unicsmcr.com/">sponsor a hackathon</a>, deliver a guest lecture, host your own event or <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/">become a software engineering mentor</a>. Employers who engage <strong>early and often</strong> are much more likely to get something back. As an employer, you may also be interested in events run by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://ise.org.uk/">Institute of Student Employers</a> (ISE)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.agcas.org.uk">Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services</a> (AGCAS)</li>

## Guest lectures from employers {#guestlectures}

The Department of Computer Science welcomes external speakers and hosts a number of guest lectures from a wide range of collaborators in industry and academia. There are several ways the department can host guest lectures

* Scheduled lectures for [COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/), a first year course with 400+ enrolled students. During 2021, these talks take place on Mondays from midday to 12.50pm on zoom
* School research seminars , see [examples of past seminars](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/events/past-events/)
* Technical talks arranged as part of a scheduled course, speak to the [course leader for the relevant course](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/). These tend to be more advanced courses aimed at students later in their degrees or as part of postgraduate study.
* One-off talks arranged *ad hoc* that are not part of scheduled series of lectures
* Seminars and talks from speakers arranged and booked by students, for example [unicsmcr.com](https://unicsmcr.com/), The University of Manchester Computer Science society

### Examples of COMP101 lectures

Some example guest lectures for COMP101 are shown below to give a flavour of the kind of talks that are appropriate

* Hacking the Hacks, delivered by NCC Group
* Debunking the myths associated with User Experience, delivered by American Express

### Interested in speaking?
For COMP101, we are always looking for good speakers who can engage large groups of students on interesting topics that they care about and relate to Computer Science. For COMP101, there are a limited number of guest lecture slots (around 20) which run through term-time starting in November and finishing in early June. Its important that speakers

* Give much more than a sales pitch for an organisation, by providing insight into a technical subject
* Talk about content that relates to the (very broad) syllabus of COMP101
* Engage, interact, educate and entertain. Students vote with their feet (by not turning up) if they think a lecture won't be interesting
* If you would like to propose a guest lecture for COMP101, please contact Duncan Hull. For all other external seminars and events, see the links above.

Since lockdown, lectures have been online, which has allowed for more interaction, typically via the chat dialogue. We can monitor and moderate the chat, feeding questions to the speaker when it's appropriate.-->
