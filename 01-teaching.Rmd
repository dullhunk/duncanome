# Students {#teaching}

I teach, mentor, tutor, lecture on and supervise a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. You can find me online during office hours, in the labs, my office hours, on [youtube.com/\@coding-your-future](https://www.youtube.com/\@coding-your-future) and in lecture theatres. 🎭

## All years: Debug your future {#allyears}

If you'd like to debug your CV, application form, covering letter and job search etc, read [debugging your future](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging) [@debugyourfuture] and [hacking your future](https://www.cdyf.me/hacking) [@hackingyourfuture], especially if you haven't written a CV, Résumé or LinkedIn profile before. Once you've done this you can send me any relevant documentation and then:

* Drop-in to my weekly one-to-one CV clinics for Computer Science students online during term-time during my open office hours
* Get feedback on your CV from as many other people as possible, because "[given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)" [@Raymond1999]

```{r bugfeature-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbuggingcv)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Features not bugs.png")
```

(ref:captionbuggingcv) Is that a bug or a feature in your CV? It's important to [debug your CV](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging) before an employer sees it, see the Wednesday Waggle for details of my weekly live debugging sessions.

Outside of term time, it's best to book a debugging appointment. 🐛

## First year students {#year1}

If you're in your first year of study, I serve as:

* Academic staff member for [First year team projects: COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/) led by [Ulrike Sattler](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/) [@COMP10120], see the [getting started with LaTeX lab manual](http://latex4year1.netlify.app)
* Mentor and tutor to one group of six first year students
* Organiser of first year guest lectures, which mostly run in the second semester, February to May





## Second year students {#year2}

If you're in your second year of study, I serve as:

* Course leader for [Coding your Future: COMP2CARS](https://www.cdyf.me/) a course designed by me for (primarily) second year students to design, build, test and debug their futures in computing.
* Organiser of the labs for the [software engineering mentoring program](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/)
* Teaching team member for [second year software engineering: COMP23311](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP23311/syllabus/), a course designed by [Suzanne Embury](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~embury/) [@COMP23311; @git]

Previously I served as [second year tutor](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/year2/) from 2016 through to 2020, and course leader for second year software engineering from 2020 to 2022.

## Penultimate year students {#penultimate}

If you're on placement during your penultimate year (your last-but-one), I serve as:

* Course leader for "with industrial experience" (IE), an elective and intercalated year in industry.
* Year tutor for students on placement, either face to face or via telecon

## Final year students {#finalyear}

If you're in your final year of study, you'll find me:

* Supervising final year educational projects based in secondary schools in Greater Manchester, see [coding their future](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/coding-their-future). [@computinged] 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Masters students {#masters}

If you're doing a Masters degree, you'll find me:

* Leading the course on [Principles of Digital Biology](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/pgt/COMP60532/syllabus/) which covers [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), [Computational Biolgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) and a bit of [medical informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics) 🧬
* Supervising [Master of Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/) projects in Computer Science and Data Science. [@r4ds] This typically involves various combinations of Wikipedia, Wikdata, [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) [@ducharme] and chatbots. 🤖 [@myca]

## PhD students {#phds}

If you've got any interesting PhD research ideas you like to pitch to me, particularly if they involve [computer science education](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk) or professional issues, I'm all ears! 👂

## Extracurricular

Outside all of the above, I also get involved in:

* Organising, facilitating and promoting extra-curricular activities such as [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) [@Briscoe; @Warner2017] and [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon). [@goodbadugly; @troubled; @findingada2019] These usually occur off-timetable, for example Wednesday afternoons, evenings and weekends.
* Judging competitions such as [studenthack.com](https://www.studenthack.com) and [greatunihack.com](https://greatunihack.com) since 2014. These two hackathons are organised by [UniCS](https://www.unicsmcr.com/), a student-led tech society formed by the merger of HackSoc (computer geekery) and CSSoc (socialising). Many other hackathons exist, they are usually aimed at beginners looking to learn new skills, rather than experts looking to compete. [@Briscoe; @hafb]
