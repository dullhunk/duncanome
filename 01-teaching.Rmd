## All Years: Debug Your Future {#allyears}

If you'd like to debug your CV, application form, covering letter and job search etc, read [debugging your future](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging) [@debugyourfuture] and [hacking your future](https://www.cdyf.me/hacking) [@hackingyourfuture], especially if you haven't written a CV, R√©sum√© or LinkedIn profile before. Once you've checked your CV against short checklist at [cdyf.me/debugging#quick](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging#quick) you can get feedback from me by submitting your CV (etc) at [bit.ly/debug-my-cv](https://bit.ly/debug-my-cv) or using the QR code in figure \@ref(fig:qr-fig)

```{r qr-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "33%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionqr)"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/qr.jpg", 3))
```

(ref:captionqr) Once you've self-checked your CV using [cdyf.me/debugging#quick](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging#quick) you can get feedback by submitting your CV (etc) at [bit.ly/debug-my-cv](https://bit.ly/debug-my-cv) (login required)
 
Once you've submitted your CV you can:


* Drop-in to my weekly one-to-one CV clinics for Computer Science students online during term-time during my open office hours, Wednesday 10am to midday on the lower first floor of the Kilburn building
* Get feedback on your CV from as many other people as possible, because "[given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)" [@Raymond1999]

```{r bugfeature-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbuggingcv)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Features not bugs.png")
```

(ref:captionbuggingcv) Is that a bug or a feature in your CV? It's important to [debug your CV](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging) before an employer sees it, see the Wednesday Waggle for details of my weekly live debugging sessions.

Outside of term time, it's best to book a debugging appointment. üêõ

## Masters Students {#masters}

If you're doing a Masters degree, you'll find me:

* Leading the course on [Principles of Digital Biology](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/pgt/COMP60532/syllabus/) which covers [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), [Computational Biolgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) and a bit of [medical informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics) üß¨

## PhD Students {#phds}

If you've got any interesting PhD research ideas you like to pitch to me, particularly if they involve [computer science education](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk) or professional issues, I'm all ears! üëÇ

## Extracurricular and Flexible Learning {#extra}

Outside all of the above, I'm a promoter and supporter of flexible and extracurricular learning including:

* Organising, facilitating and promoting extra-curricular activities such as [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) [@Briscoe; @Warner2017] and [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon). [@goodbadugly; @troubled; @findingada2019] These usually occur off-timetable, for example Wednesday afternoons, evenings and weekends.
* Judging competitions such as [studenthack.com](https://www.studenthack.com) and [greatunihack.com](https://greatunihack.com) since 2014. These two hackathons are organised by [UniCS](https://www.unicsmcr.com/), a student-led tech society formed by the merger of HackSoc (computer geekery) and CSSoc (socialising). Many other hackathons exist, they are usually aimed at beginners looking to learn new skills, rather than experts looking to compete. [@Briscoe; @hafb]
* Piloting the introduction of Microsoft Fundamental Certifications across the University in collaboration with the [Flexible Learning Program](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/teaching-and-learning-excellence/flexible-learning/) see [cdyf.me/achieving#microsoft](https://www.cdyf.me/achieving#microsoft).
