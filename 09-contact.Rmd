# Contacting the Future {#contact}

> The future has arrived ‚Äî It‚Äôs Just Not Evenly Distributed Yet. [@gibson]

Unfortunately you can't contact the future, yet. While we wait for the future to become more evenly distrubuted you *can* contact me using the information below which includes directions to the Kilburn Buidling and parking information.

(ref:captioncycloturing) Paying homage to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) at a mural on the [Princess Parkway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5103_road) by [tankpetrol.com](http://tankpetrol.com/). According to [Jonathan Swinton](https://www.manturing.net/jonathan), Turing is the ‚Äúpatron saint of Manchester‚Äù [@manturing]. As a [Manchester icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Manchester), he is commemorated locally by the [Alan Turing building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Building), the [Alan Turing Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Memorial), [some blue plaques](https://duncan.hull.name/2021/07/07/turings-house/) and the [Alan Turing Way](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alan+Turing+Way,+Manchester/) [@turingway]

## Please Try Reading The Friendly Manual First {#rtfm}

If you're a student, please make sure you've [Read The Friendly Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) (RTFM), before asking me or my colleagues. There's a good chance your question will already be answered there, in particular:

* The Undergraduate (UG) Handbook <!--[wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/UGHandbook23:Main](https://wiki.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/UGHandbook23:Main)-->
* The Placement handbook
* The student support website at [www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk](https://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/)

## Student Support {#sso}

If you can't find an answer to your question in section \@ref(rtfm), then get in touch. Bear in mind, I might not be the best person to talk to, depending on what you want. If you're a student, you might be better off contacting student support in person by the neon signs in the [Nancy Rothwell Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell_Building), see figure \@ref(fig:sso-fig).


```{r sso-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:captionstudentsupport)", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/studentsupport.jpg")
```
(ref:captionstudentsupport) The Student Support Office (SSO) on the first floor of the [Nancy Rothwell Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Rothwell_Building) are here to help you, they should be your first port of call.
