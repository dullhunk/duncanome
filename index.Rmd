(ref:helloworldy) [Hello, World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_World): my name is Duncan and I'm a Senior Lecturer ([Associate Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor)) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. The left hand side of this picture is what I look like now, the right hand side was taken when I was a longer-haired undergraduate. 🎓

Hello and welcome to the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). My [name is Duncan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_(given_name)) and I'm a Senior Lecturer ([Associate Professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor)) with responsibility for managing our [Industrial Experience](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/industrial-experience/) (IE) program. I [teach](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/teaching) undergraduate & postgraduate students, supervise tutorials & projects while serving as [industrial experience & employability tutor](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/placement/), [departmental forum](https://bit.ly/cs-departmental-forum) chair and a member of [University senate](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/governance/structure/senate/). I'm interested [improving teaching, learning and the student experience](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/research.html) by:

* Developing and delivering *Coding Your Future*: a course & guidebook for students at [cdyf.me](https://www.cdyf.me)
* Improving students communication skills by enabling them to start [writing their future](https://www.cdyf.me/writing), [debugging their future](https://www.cdyf.me/debugging) and [speaking their future](https://www.cdyf.me/speaking)
* Engaging with a wide range of employers through [our industry club](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/)
* Growing and building the teaching community by journal clubbing at [sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://sigcse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) and serving on the board of [uki-sigcse.acm.org](https://uki-sigcse.acm.org/)
* Supporting local schools both as a school governor and with the project [Coding Their Future](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/coding-their-future.html)
* Teaching engineers to [make better software](https://software-eng.netlify.app/) in collaboration with our [industrial mentors](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/connect/business-engagement/industrial-mentoring/)
* Updating students weekly on opportunities with the Wednesday Waggle newsletter at [waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk](https://waggle.cs.manchester.ac.uk/waggle/about) 🐝

Our elective industrial experience program has [up to 100](#employability) students every year working in paid employment for the penultimate (“sandwich”) year-in-industry of their undergraduate degrees. If you are an [employer](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/employers.html) who would like to recruit a summer intern, placement student or graduate please [get in touch](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact.html).

## Full stack teaching  {-}
Regardless of the age or the stage, I enjoy the challenges of teaching and have taught english, maths, science and engineering to primary & secondary school children, undergraduates & postgraduates. In 2011, I completed a [Postgraduate Certificate in Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_Certificate_in_Education) (PGCE) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/) and worked as a high school science teacher in co-educational [comprehensive (non-selective) state schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school) in Swindon, Shaftesbury and Stockport before returning to higher education. I serve as a [school governor](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/connect/teachers/school-governors/) on the governing board of a school in Greater Manchester. As well as teaching in the UK I have also taught in India, Japan and America too. 🇪🇺🇬🇧🇮🇳🇯🇵🇺🇸

## What's the Story? {-}
What's the story, Jackanory? Born in [Bath, Somerset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset) and raised using a [secret West Country recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country), [my story](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/duncanhull) is a mixture of Natural Science ([Plant Sciences, BSc](https://speakerdeck.com/dullhunk/why-study-plants)), Computer Science ([MSc](mastersofscience.html) & [PhD](https://www.librarysearch.manchester.ac.uk/permalink/44MAN_INST/1r887gn/alma992976677936301631)) and software engineering. Outside of academia, I’ve worked as a consultant and software developer for [BBC Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Monitoring), the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company) and the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) (NHS). As an academic, I have been part of the [e-Science lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/), [Apache Taverna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Taverna) and [myGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyGrid) projects and completed a [postdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) at the [Manchester Institute of Biotechnology](https://www.mib.manchester.ac.uk/) (MIB) on the [Pathtext project](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20529930/). This was followed by a short stint as a software engineer of [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChEBI) (ChEBI) at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute) (EBI) in Cambridge, UK. 🧬👨‍🔬
